# Show me the code

## What you have to install

You have to:

`pip install pandas`

`pip install python-pipedrive`

or

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

I`m using the folow lib instead to call the Pipedrive API: https://pypi.org/project/python-pipedrive/

## What you have to config

Please, open the `config.py` and put your API key. Just it! have a fan :)
